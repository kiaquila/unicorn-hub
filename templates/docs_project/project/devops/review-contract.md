# Review Contract

Reviewers check the pull request against the active feature spec, not only
against the implementation diff. Acceptance criteria, negative scenarios, and
known issues are the source of truth for expected behavior.

## Codex

Native GitHub PR review. Blocking findings use `P0`, `P1`, or `P2`. Advisory findings use `P3`.

When Codex has no inline findings, a top-level `Codex Review:` summary comment from the trusted Codex bot also satisfies the gate only if it names the current head SHA.

## Claude

Top-level comment must start with:

```text
AI_REVIEW_AGENT: claude
AI_REVIEW_SHA: <head-sha>
AI_REVIEW_OUTCOME: pass|advisory|block
```

Only `pass` satisfies the gate.

## Gemini

Native GitHub PR review from the configured app. Critical or high-severity findings block merge.
